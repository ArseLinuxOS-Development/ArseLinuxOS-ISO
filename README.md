This ISO is based on a modified Arch-ISO to provide Installation Environment for ArseLinuxOS.

As you can imagine, this project is for fun and isn't meant to be used for anything serious, or rather, anything at all.



# Development

I use Vagrant to make spinning up a VM simple and easy.

To start helping out, clone the repository on a VM, if you use Vagrant it should install the packages required. 
Make any changes, use the `buid-iso.sh` script and test the ISO to make sure changes have taken effect.




# TODO

- [ ] - Setup Calamares installer
- [ ] - Create a logo
- [ ] - Probably need a custom repo for certain packages (no clue how involved this is)
- [ ] - Create a live environment so users have an immediate look at the distribution.
